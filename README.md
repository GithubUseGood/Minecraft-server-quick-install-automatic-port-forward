# Minecraft server quick install and port forward
 
Executable file that installs a minecraft server for you, and also does all the port forwarding.
Just download the .exe file and place it anywhere and run it. 
It will then procced to install a spiggot server 1.21.
Automatically start it, and port forward  port 25565(minecraft default)
If something doesnt work feel free to message me, or message me on instagram @roundearthslovenia.

Made completely in C#. Using .NET.
For the port forwarding part i used Upnp.
